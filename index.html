<B>Disclaimer:</B> I won't guarantee that this works well or even that
it won't suddenly cause your car's tires to go flat. If you have
problems with this bookmark, please 
<a href="https://github.com/rbuccigrossi/CostpointKeepAlive/issues">file an issue report</a>
because it's my fault. Currently <b>I have only tested it on Chrome.</b>

<P>

Are you tired of having Costpoint's sessions expire on you? Then
behold! I have a bookmark that will check every 10 seconds to see if the
"Session Timeout" dialog appeared, and if so, will press the button for
you.

<P>

To use it click-drag (click, hold, and drag) on the following link and drag it into your Bookmark bar:

<P>
<a href="javascript:(function(){ setInterval(function(){ if (!(window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById("timeoutDiv")).display === "none")){ document.getElementById("timeoutBtn").click();};},10000); alert("Keep Alive Engaged");})();">Costpoint Keep Alive</a>

<P>
To use it:
<UL>
<LI>Open and log into Costpoint</LI>
<LI>Open up the Timesheet App in Costpoint</LI>
<LI>Click on your Costpoint Keep Alive bookmark</LI>
</UL>


<P>
For the curious, here is the source (every 5 minutes it clicks the
Refresh menu icon and then the 4th menu item, which refreshes the app):

<pre>
(function(){
  setInterval(function(){ 
    if (!(window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById("timeoutDiv")).display === "none")){ 
      document.getElementById("timeoutBtn").click();
    };
  },10000);
  alert("Keep Alive Engaged");
})();
</pre>
